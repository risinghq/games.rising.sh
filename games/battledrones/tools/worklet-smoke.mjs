// Worklet smoke (SOUND-DUEL.md "Worklet" > Tests): the modem's AudioWorklet,
// built the way production builds it, decoding both ways in Chromium.
//
// It builds a scratch entry that imports src/link/worklet-transport.ts (which
// imports the worklet as ./worklet.ts?worker&url) with Vite's build API and
// the project's own vite.config.ts, into a directory under the system temp
// dir (dist/ is left alone: other tools serve it, and until the lobby imports
// the rig it holds no worklet). It checks the emitted worklet is one
// self-contained IIFE (no import, export or import.meta: what addModule
// accepts) and that the service worker precaches it, then serves the build
// and, in Chromium, renders an OfflineAudioContext at 48 kHz with two modem
// nodes, host and guest, made by the real WorkletTransport:
//
//   host ──gain 0.3, 75 ms──▶ host's microphone     (own path, loud)
//   host ──gain 0.01, 3 ms──▶ guest's microphone    (peer path, 30 dB quieter)
//   guest ──gain 0.3, 75 ms─▶ guest's microphone
//   guest ──gain 0.01, 3 ms─▶ host's microphone
//   noise at −80 dBFS into both microphones
//
// (the cycles run through DelayNodes, which Web Audio requires). The guest's
// microphone arrives on its node's second input channel only, so the
// worklet's channel choice is exercised too. The host sends a list of three
// frames in key rotation, the guest one frame; 6 s in, the rendering
// suspends and the host's list is replaced, and the rotation must go on by
// key. Both must lock, decode 30 packets or more with no bad ones, and post
// no errors. The same build runs again with the bare worklet driven by its raw
// messages (the protocol alone, as --dist below needs). The transports run on
// the offline context's own clock (options.clock): an offline render has no
// wall clock to keep up with, and on performance.now() one slower than real
// time (a busy host) reads as a context that stopped, which the transport
// rightly posts as a skip; the modem then jumps at the next suspension and
// the rotation breaks (a render held to 0.44× for 2 s of audio posted 1.8
// and 2.3 s skips both ways and cut the packet in flight at the swap). So no
// skip may be posted here.
//
// Then, on the same build, two real-time AudioContexts, host and guest,
// each hearing itself loud and the other quietly through a MediaStream (the
// air between them); once they hear each other the guest's context is
// suspended for 0.7 s, then 1.5 s, and resumed (--no-realtime skips it).
// Neither transport may post a skip while running; the guest's must post the
// stretch as one skip after, within SUSPEND_AGREE_MS (60) of how far its
// context's clock fell behind across it (the modem reports the skip as a
// capture gap of that length), which must lie between the time it was
// suspended and the time from suspend() to resume() settling (a busy main
// thread stretches the latter: 856 ms around a 684 ms step, the main thread
// held 150 ms as resume() settled). The host
// must hear the guest again within a second (the skip starts a new
// superframe), the guest the host within 1.7 s. (The guest's own receiver
// gains little from the skip in Chromium: its MediaStream input comes back on
// a 10 ms grid, about 20 ms off what the context's clock says, so its lock on
// the host is stale. The host, hearing the guest again after more than a
// second on the new superframe the skip started, starts a new superframe of
// its own, and the guest hears that: about a second after the resume, 1.6 s
// at worst in 40, where it waited for the host's next sync before, 1.8 s in
// this scene's timing and up to 2.6 s; so 1.7 s fails a host that no longer
// restarts, and a busy host's slow one gets the second attempt.)
//
// Real time runs on a host that may be busy, and some of what happens in it
// is the browser's, not the modem's. The page reads each context's clock
// against performance.now() every 25 ms from the moment it runs, as the
// transport does, and holds every skip posted while running against it
// (running()). A stall of the browser's audio stops both contexts at once
// and each transport rightly posts it (both posted a 104 ms skip together
// under load on 4 CPUs, 1 run in 5; stopping the browser's audio service for
// 200 ms leaves each context's clock 188–193 ms behind for good): a skip in
// each context within STALL_WINDOW_MS, each matched within STALL_AGREE_MS by
// how far its own clock fell behind and stayed, is let through and logged
// (the two lengths needn't agree: 193.8 and 173.8 ms once). A render thread
// held up alone renders what it owes as soon as it runs again (a 300 ms hold
// caught up within 20 ms), so a lasting step in one context only is rarer,
// but seen under load; and a transport could leave part of a stall
// unreported (127.1 ms skipped of one its clock put at 224.1, after a 200 ms
// stop of the audio service: 4 such stops in 8) or post one its context then
// caught up (a 346.6 ms skip whose clock settled 91 ms behind, under load).
// It now waits for its clock to stop moving before it measures the step
// (WorkletTransport), which leaves a context that stands still for 200 ms
// and only then catches up. A skip is held against the level the clock
// stood at just before the stall, and against the lowest of the 2.5 s
// before, which the transport's own baseline may still hold: a step of
// 30–120 ms a little earlier, too small to skip, is in one and not the other
// (taken against the lowest alone, a 200.2 ms skip of a stall that took the
// clock from 57 to 254 ms behind read as short of it, the 57 counted in,
// with the audio service stopped 200 ms at a time). None of these is let
// through, but a busy host makes them all; the last two are printed as a NOTE
// for the transport's owner. And Chromium sometimes hands
// the resumed guest one to three render quanta of digital silence (2.7 to
// 10.7 ms seen, 4 resumes in 52), which the modem rightly reports as a
// capture gap: a gap of at most RESUME_SILENCE_MS within RESUME_EDGE_MS of
// resume() is let through, and logged; the skip's own gap must still be there
// at its length. Last, one that may be either's: now and then a receiver
// misses the first sync after the skip and hears its friend a superframe
// later (the host the guest 2457 and 2648 ms after a 0.7 s suspension, where
// it is usually 190–700 ms; the guest the host 3448 ms after one): a NOTE for
// the receiver's owner, pass or fail. Two causes were the receiver's, and are
// gone: a new superframe's sync one symbol after the old one's, which hid it,
// and one that came in while the trial on the old one ran, dropped when that
// trial won. One is Chromium's: the guest's MediaStream input stepping 10 ms
// within the trial on the host's first sync (1 resume in 40).
//
// So a problem is hard or not (checkRealtime): hard when a busy host can't
// make it (worklet errors, a skip whose context's clock never fell behind by
// it, a suspension skipped wrong, a capture gap the skips and the resume
// don't account for), and then the smoke fails at once; otherwise (a hearing
// too slow, any of the skips above but a shared stall, missing clock
// readings) the whole real-time section runs once more in a fresh tab, both
// attempts printed, with every threshold as it is, and it passes only if the
// second attempt passes whole. The OK line says when it took two.
//
// Then the same offline scenario through Vite's dev server, where the
// worklet is an ES module with imports (--no-dev skips it). With --dist it also runs
// against the worklet in an existing dist/ (after `npm run build`, once the
// lobby imports the rig), driving the node with raw messages since the
// transport is inside the lobby's chunk there.
//
// (Offline rendering runs flat out, and Chromium hands the worklet the main
// thread's messages only while it is suspended, so the scenario suspends one
// quantum after each message it posts. A real-time context delivers them
// between quanta.)
//
// Usage: node tools/worklet-smoke.mjs [--no-dev] [--no-realtime] [--dist] [--keep]
// Prints WORKLET SMOKE OK (with "real time on its second attempt" when it
// took two, and "see the NOTE above" after a NOTE), or FAIL lines and exits
// non-zero.
