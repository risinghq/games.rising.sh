/**
 * The host of a four-player online battle (FFA.md "The host"): the page that
 * made the battle code. It holds the "host" seat of each friend seat's relay
 * room, keeps the lobby, sets the match up, and seals the turn log: each tick
 * it takes the orders that have reached it (its own after HOST_DELAY ticks,
 * so it has no edge on its friends' round trip), stamps them with their
 * seat's side, and sends the log on to every friend.
 *
 * A friend who goes quiet for DROP_MS gets a stand-in commander (a control
 * event in the log, so every page switches on the same tick), and their seat
 * back once they have caught up again. A friend falling behind (a slow phone,
 * a weak link) makes the host wait up to STALL_MAX_MS, then the battle goes
 * on and they catch up by playing faster. Engine-free: the sockets and the
 * clock come in through options (tests drive it with fakes).
