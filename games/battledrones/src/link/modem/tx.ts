/**
 * The transmitter (SOUND-DUEL.md "The modem" > Transmitter). Its timeline is
 * the AudioWorklet's frame counter: symbols start on frames that are whole
 * multiples of the symbol length, so a jump in the counter (frames the audio
 * thread never rendered) skips samples instead of delaying everything after
 * it, and the peer sees a dropout rather than a shifted stream.
 *
 * Each symbol is the band's tones at equal amplitude over prefix + useful
 * part, from a persistent oscillator bank: a tone's state is set once at its
 * symbol's start and stepped sample by sample, so a block's output is exactly
 * that block's samples whatever the block size. A symbol runs on for TW
 * samples into the next one's prefix while the next fades in (raised
 * cosine), which keeps the spectrum tight at the symbol edges.
 *
 * Phases change differentially: pilots never change, a sync symbol puts
 * pattern A (the superframe is robust) or B (fast) on the data tones, and the
 * data symbols after it add 0/π (robust) or Gray-coded quarter turns (fast)
 * to each data tone.
 *
 * Payloads. The transmitter holds a list of up to MAX_PAYLOADS frames, each
 * with a key, and every packet latches one at its first symbol: the first
 * whose key is greater than the last key sent, wrapping to the first
 * (transport.ts nextFrameIndex, the rule every transport shares). The last
 * key sent outlives the list, so a new list continues the rotation by key
 * rather than starting over: a segment that was just sent waits its turn
 * even if the list around it changed. A payload longer than the band on air
 * carries (a list set before a switch to the low plan) is never cut to fit:
 * a cut frame would pass its CRC as something nobody sent. Its packet goes
 * out as zeros instead, and the rotation moves on past it.
