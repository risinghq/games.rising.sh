/**
 * The receiver (SOUND-DUEL.md "The modem" > Receiver): acquisition, the
 * locked tracker, packet decoding and the lock's life.
 *
 *  - The sync search runs all the time over the receive band (both plans'
 *    host bands while a Join is detecting the plan). A candidate away from
 *    the current lock's syncs starts a trial: a second tracker that
 *    demodulates the candidate's first packet from the input history. Lock
 *    is declared (or moved) only when that packet passes its CRC and the
 *    gate.
 *  - A trial measures the clock first: the pilots alone over the sync and
 *    four data symbols, whose mean slope initialises ε̂. Then it demodulates
 *    for real from the sync again, with the tones where the clock puts them.
 *    Beyond about 500 ppm between the phones the slope is ambiguous by a
 *    turn of the pilots (tracker.ts). When the stream's previous sync is
 *    still in the correlator's history, one superframe earlier, the timing
 *    difference of the two (the spec's other initialisation) picks the turn.
 *    Otherwise the friend's clock as the lock knew it does (the live lock's
 *    ε̂, or the last one's after it dropped): a friend whose stream restarted
 *    (a jump) or stepped keeps its clock, and its new sync has no previous
 *    one a superframe before it. With neither, the turn whose pilots fit
 *    clearly best does; but near 600 ppm the first pass looks for every tone
 *    nearly half a bin from where it is, the tones leak into each other, and
 *    two turns can fit about as well. Then a first packet that fails on the
 *    best gets a second try on the other, from the sync again, before the
 *    candidate is given up: the CRC and the gate decide, as they do the mode
 *    of a superframe whose sync was missed. (Without these, at 600 ppm half
 *    the acquisitions without a pair waited a superframe for one.)
 *  - Where the band holds a steady tone (the sync search excised one in the
 *    superframe before the sync), the second pass starts PRE_SYMBOLS before
 *    the sync. A lock rides such a tone out on each tone's mean of d̃, its
 *    steady share (decode.ts, tracker.ts), but a trial had no such means for
 *    the first packet that decides the lock: a tone between two of the
 *    friend's, 23 dB or more over its tone, left the friend never heard, and
 *    a lock that rode it out never came back after a dropout. The 16 symbols
 *    before the sync give the means (the stream's last data, or the tone
 *    alone before a stream began, either averaging to the tone's share):
 *    robust is heard to 30 dB now, fast to 26 (as far as its running lock
 *    holds). They cost the pass 16 symbols more from history, about 0.15 s,
 *    so a band without such a tone goes without them.
 *  - Locked, every expected sync is re-correlated within ±5 ms: it sets the
 *    superframe's mode and trims the timing by at most 0.5 ms. If neither
 *    pattern clears 0.3, the timing stays and that superframe's packets are
 *    decoded both ways (the CRC and the gate decide); a lock that has missed
 *    its sync is dropped after 4 more packets fail.
 *  - Packets overlapping a gap are erased: neither decoded nor counted.
 *  - A sync that comes in while a trial runs is held for after it (the
 *    strongest, if several), and tried when the trial fails, or when it wins
 *    and the new lock doesn't expect that sync: a friend that restarted its
 *    stream just after the sync the trial took (a skip on resuming) leaves
 *    that lock stale at once, and dropping the held sync then cost a
 *    superframe.
 *  - A packet is delivered once. When the friend's timing steps (its output
 *    latency changed) the lock can decode a packet at the old timing while a
 *    trial, started from the sync at the new one, decodes the same packet as
 *    its first: a delivery whose window starts within ¾ of the shortest
 *    packet of one already delivered is that packet again, and is dropped.
