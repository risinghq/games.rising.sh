/**
 * ModemCore (SOUND-DUEL.md "The modem" > ModemCore API): the whole acoustic
 * modem behind one process(input, output) call per audio block, the same in
 * the AudioWorklet, in the simulated room and in Node tests. It transmits in
 * one band and receives in another (or the same, for the one-phone
 * self-test), all the time.
 *
 * Each call renders exactly its block from the oscillator bank, writes the
 * input into the history ring, lets the trackers fold in what they can
 * within a budget, and runs at most one deferred heavy job (a Viterbi decode
 * first, else one FFT of the sync search). Nothing is allocated in process()
 * after construction; take(), takeSlots(), takeGaps() and stats() build the
 * messages.
 *
 * Allowed globals only (the worklet's rule): no timers, performance, self,
 * import.meta, TextEncoder or crypto anywhere under src/link/modem.
 *
 * The frame. process() takes an optional third argument, the block's first
 * frame (the worklet's currentFrame). Without it blocks are taken as
 * back to back. A frame ahead of the expected one is a jump: the frames in
 * between were never rendered or captured, so the transmitter skips them
 * (and restarts its superframe at the next symbol boundary) and the
 * receiver zero-fills them as a gap of known length.
 *
 * A capture gap alone (blocks of digital silence, or of non-finite samples:
 * the microphone, not the audio thread, failed) leaves the transmitter be.
 * The spec restarts the superframe after any local gap, but here the output
 * was rendered on time all along, so the friend's lock on it is intact, and
 * a restart would only make the friend lose a superframe re-acquiring it.
 *
 * Re-acquiring a friend. When the receiver wins a lock on a friend it had
 * not heard for over REACQUIRE_S (its previous packet delivered that long
 * before the new lock's first), on a sync off the superframe grid of the
 * stream it knew (the live lock's, or the last one's after it dropped), the
 * transmitter starts a new superframe at its next symbol boundary. A friend
 * whose stream started over had its audio stop (a suspension, its frame
 * counter jumping), so it heard nothing meanwhile either, and its lock on
 * this phone may be stale: its next sync would otherwise be up to a
 * superframe away. The case is a phone whose context was suspended. It
 * starts a new superframe on its skip, and its friend re-acquires it within
 * a second; but its own microphone comes back about 20 ms off the context's
 * clock (Chromium), so its lock on the friend is stale and it waited for the
 * friend's next sync, up to 2.5 s. With the friend's restart it hears it
 * about half a second after the friend re-acquired it: in the room with that
 * offset (24 suspensions), 1.12 s after the resume on average and 1.80 s at
 * worst, against 1.68 and 2.75 s; in Chromium (tools/worklet-smoke.mjs's two
 * contexts, 0.7 s suspensions), a median of 0.97 s and 1.6 s at worst in 20,
 * against 1.82 and 2.0 s in 30. A friend whose stream went on, on the grid
 * this phone knew, lost nothing to its own audio (noise at this microphone,
 * its speaker muted, both muted): a restart would only cost it a packet.
 * (Before the grid was asked, the friend's speaker muted for 2.5 s restarted
 * this phone in 7 rooms of 12, its friend's longest wait between packets
 * going from 0.15–0.45 to 0.35–0.55 s; both muted restarted one or both in
 * all 12, and in the high plan the friend heard this phone 0.4 s later for
 * it.) A phone that restarted since it last heard the friend (on its own
 * skip, say) doesn't: the friend is re-acquiring that restart already. One
 * that restarted before it lost the friend (a stall of its own audio a
 * moment earlier) still does; held off by any restart in the last
 * RESTART_GUARD_S, a host whose audio stalled a second before its guest's
 * 1.5 s suspension left the guest waiting for its next sync, 2.1 s after the
 * resume (Chromium). A restart while the friend was away holds it too,
 * though the friend can't have heard it: a host whose audio stalls during
 * its guest's suspension leaves the guest waiting a superframe, as before
 * (seen with Chromium's audio service stopped 200 ms every 4 s, 4 of 8
 * suspensions). It can't ping-pong: the friend restarted on its own
 * jump, after it last heard this phone; a restart costs a friend that kept
 * its lock on this phone a packet or so (0.28–0.60 s between packets in 12
 * rooms, the low plan's robust packets the longest), under REACQUIRE_S; and
 * a phone restarts for a re-acquisition at most once per RESTART_GUARD_S.
 *
 * Plan detection. A Join (rx "detect") searches both plans' host bands, and
 * until it locks it transmits in the high plan's guest band (16–19 kHz),
 * whatever plan it was given, when the rate carries it: the low plan's guest
 * band ends 25 Hz below the high host band, and its own loud signal there
 * would bury the host's sync in the very band it is searching. Its
 * capacity() meanwhile is the smaller of the two plans' (186 bits), not the
 * spec's 188: a frame sized to it must still fit if detection picks the low
 * plan.
 *
 * Payloads (SOUND-DUEL.md "Segments and rotation"). setPayloads() hands over
 * a list of frames; each packet takes the next one in key rotation at its
 * first symbol, and its slot event names the key it carried.
 *
 * Where the spec is silent:
 *  - a list holds at most 8 frames (MAX_PAYLOADS; the lockstep's K is at
 *    most 4). A list that breaks a rule (empty, too long, keys not strictly
 *    ascending or not finite, a frame over capacity or with fewer bytes than
 *    its nbits) throws a RangeError and leaves the old list in place;
 *  - a packet sent before any list carries all zeros, and its slot's key is
 *    null; so does a packet whose payload is longer than the band now on air
 *    carries (a list set before a switch to the low plan): it is never cut
 *    to fit, which would deliver, CRC and all, a frame nobody sent;
 *  - the last key sent outlives a new list, a frame counter going back and a
 *    reconfiguration: rotation follows which frame went out last, and none
 *    of these change that.
