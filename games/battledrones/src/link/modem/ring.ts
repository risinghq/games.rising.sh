/**
 * The receiver's input history: the last 2.7 s or so of microphone samples,
 * indexed by input frame (the AudioWorklet's currentFrame domain), and the
 * recent gaps — stretches whose samples never arrived (a frame-counter jump,
 * or a block of digital silence while transmitting). Gaps are zero-filled,
 * so timing survives them, and any symbol window that overlaps one is
 * treated as erased rather than decoded.
 *
 * Acquisition finds a sync some 100 ms after it went by, so the first
 * packet after it is demodulated from here; afterwards the trackers keep
 * reading from here too, normally a block behind the newest sample.
