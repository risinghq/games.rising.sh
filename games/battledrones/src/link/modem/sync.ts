/**
 * Acquisition (SOUND-DUEL.md "The modem" > Receiver): a normalized
 * correlation of the band-passed input with the sync symbol's data tones,
 * ρ(t) = |⟨x_bp, template⟩| / (‖x_bp‖·‖template‖) over the 40 ms useful
 * length, for pattern A (robust) and B (fast), computed by FFT overlap-save
 * spread across the audio blocks.
 *
 * Three details the spec's formula leaves open:
 *
 *  - The inner product is the analytic one (its magnitude, the correlation's
 *    envelope). The real correlation of a 3 kHz band oscillates at the band's
 *    centre frequency, so at 17 kHz a peak falling between two samples could
 *    read as little as 0.4 of itself; the envelope is smooth, polarity-blind
 *    and reads the same whatever the phase.
 *  - The band-pass is folded into the overlap-save kernels: x_bp = h ∗ x for
 *    the norm, (template ∗ h) for the inner product. Both outputs are
 *    band-limited, so each inverse FFT takes only the band's bins and runs a
 *    quarter of the size, giving ρ at every 4th sample (the envelope is far
 *    smoother than that).
 *  - A real FFT is done as a half-size complex one.
 *
 * The candidate must be the maximum within ±45 ms, where the spec says
 * ±50: under a symbol. A sender whose frame counter jumps just after a sync
 * starts a new superframe at the next symbol boundary, so its new sync can
 * come exactly one symbol after the old one, which (as strong or stronger)
 * hid it at ±50 ms; the trial on the old sync then failed (its packet was
 * cut by the jump) and the receiver waited a superframe for the next. The
 * echoes the window is there for, 8–15 ms on and the room's tail below
 * them, stay well inside ±45 ms.
 *
 * And one addition: before the band-pass, any FFT bin whose power stands
 * EXCISE times over the median of the band's bins is zeroed. A steady tone
 * in the band (coil whine, a beacon, a harmonic of game audio) otherwise
 * fills ‖x_bp‖: one 9 dB louder than the friend's whole band divides ρ by
 * three and hides every sync. The friend's own spectrum never stands that
 * far over its median, so without such a tone nothing changes.
 *
 * The forward FFT, then three small inverse FFTs per band (x_bp, A, B) are
 * separate jobs, at most one per process() call. Above 96 kHz each FFT is
 * itself split into parts, a few passes each, so no one job grows with the
 * rate faster than the audio block shrinks.
