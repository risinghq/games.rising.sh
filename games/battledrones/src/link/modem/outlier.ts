/**
 * Narrowband interference (a deviation from SOUND-DUEL.md's soft-bit and
 * pilot-fit formulas, which weight every tone by its magnitude alone).
 *
 * A steady tone in the receive band — coil whine, a fan, an ultrasonic
 * beacon, a harmonic of game audio — lands on one or two of the friend's
 * tones and makes them far louder than their neighbours. Weighted by
 * magnitude, such a tone becomes the most trusted one in the band: its
 * soft bits sit at the clamp, four times as sure as any clean bit, though
 * its phase is the interferer's and half of them are wrong; one loud pilot
 * steers the clock fit wherever its interferer points. A channel peak, by
 * contrast, rises only a few dB over the tones beside it.
 *
 * Two signatures give such a tone away.
 *
 *  - It is loud. Each tone is measured against the median of its
 *    neighbourhood (a few tones either side, so a band whose level slopes —
 *    a speaker rolling off at 18 kHz — is not mistaken for interference). Up
 *    to OUTLIER times that median the tone keeps its magnitude weight,
 *    exactly as the spec has it; beyond, the weight falls as OUTLIER³/r² (r
 *    its ratio to the median), so a tone a steady interferer has made 10 dB
 *    louder counts for a tenth of a clean one, and 20 dB louder for next to
 *    nothing: an erasure, which the code corrects with ease, rather than
 *    four confident errors, which it can't. (ToneWeights, below: the data
 *    tones per packet in decode.ts, the pilots per symbol in tracker.ts.)
 *  - It is steady. A tone between two of the friend's leaks into a dozen of
 *    them, each only a little louder than its neighbours. But the scrambled
 *    data turns each tone's differential product d̃ at random, symbol after
 *    symbol, while an interferer adds the same rotation every time, so the
 *    running mean of d̃ (tracker.ts) is the interferer's share, once it
 *    stands clear of what the products' spread leaves in a mean (a burst of
 *    noise leaves a large one, which isn't steady). A data tone whose signal
 *    stands less than twice over that share has its weight scaled by
 *    (SIR/2)², SIR being the ratio of the two (decode.ts).
 *
 * Neither changes anything when no tone is interfered.
