/**
 * A sound duel's in-match overlays and its report section (SOUND-DUEL.md
 * "Pause, resign, leave, background", "Rig > Lifecycle", "MatchFeed and
 * GameScene"). The feed decides what shows (src/versus/feed.ts); this only
 * draws it, mounted into the HUD root next to the game's own widgets.
 *
 * - One pill for a stall: "Waiting for your friend…", "…to load", "Friend
 *   paused", "Signal lost: bring the phones closer", with "Leave (no
 *   result)" once the feed offers it (two taps: a stray one doesn't end the
 *   match). Small pills for "Orders queued", "Resigning…" and "Leaving…".
 *   The battlefield stays in view: a stalled match is still worth looking
 *   at.
 * - The full-screen "Tap to reconnect the sound link" cover when the rig
 *   lost its audio: the whole cover is the button (the tap must be a
 *   gesture: it resumes the audio and may ask for the microphone), with
 *   Leave after LEAVE_AFTER_FAILURES failed taps. After a failed tap it says
 *   why when the feed knows (the rig's reason and what to do about it).
 * - The report's "Sound duel" block: the record, the link's quality, and the
 *   end check ("Checking sync…" until the friend's end report arrives);
 *   "Your friend is back in the lobby: tap Rematch" (SOUND-DUEL.md "Rematch
 *   > Waiting"); and the reconnect, as a button, when the rig loses its
 *   audio once the match is over: the cover would hide the report's buttons.
 *
 * Text is set as text (nothing here is markup from the air). Styles live in
 * ./hud.css, which ships with the duel chunk.
 *
 * Where the spec is silent:
 *  - "Friend paused" also covers a friend that switched apps: a frame has one
 *    paused bit, and a hidden page pauses (session.ts), so the pill says
 *    "or switched away" under it;
 *  - the stall pill sits under the banner's slot (--banner-top), centred on
 *    the battlefield, and on a phone between the zoom stack and the
 *    calldowns: in short landscape under a 53px banner, and in the banner's
 *    slot itself once Leave shows (hud.css); the cover dims the screen like
 *    the pause menu.
