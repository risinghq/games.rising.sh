/**
 * The battle record of a match played here, against the AI or watched AI vs
 * AI (skirmish, the Daily Op, Last Stand and Ops): the end screen's "Copy
 * replay JSON" (ui/hud.ts). The sim is deterministic, so the record is the
 * setup the world was made from, every non-empty tick's commands as they were
 * stepped, and a world hash every HASH_EVERY ticks: 🎬 Watch a replay plays
 * it back exactly, and says so if it drifts (game/replay.ts).
 *
 * GameScene makes one for every match it sets up itself (a fed match, a duel
 * or a replay, has a record of its own: MatchFeed.battleRecord), tells it the
 * openers, and hands it each tick's commands right after step().
 *
 * Where the spec is silent:
 *  - the setup is what GameScene made the world with (its MatchOptions), so
 *    a Last Stand or an op is set up again the same way (sim/setup.ts
 *    setupWorld takes `survival` and `op` for it);
 *  - the built-in AI's income handicap (tickAi sets it every tick, from the
 *    first) goes into `income`, read off the world when the record is made;
 *  - the seats say who played: "player" for this phone, "ai:<strategy>:
 *    <difficulty>" for a commander, "waves:<difficulty>" for Last Stand's
 *    director, "op:<id>" for an op's enemy;
 *  - commands are copied as they are stepped: the Controller may keep
 *    references to the arrays it sent;
 *  - a match not decided (the record is made mid-match) has no end, and its
 *    `tick` says how far it was played.
