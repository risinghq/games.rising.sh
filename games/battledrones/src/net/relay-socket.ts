/**
 * RelaySocket: one seat of a battledrones-relay room (relay/README.md), as a
 * WebSocket that comes back by itself. The relay pairs two sockets at
 * /<code>/host and /<code>/guest and forwards each text message to the other
 * unchanged; it keeps nothing. The online duel's NetTransport carries the
 * sound duel's packets over one (src/versus/net-transport.ts); a four-player
 * battle's host holds one per friend's seat (src/ffa/).
 *
 *   const s = new RelaySocket({ code, role, onMessage })
 *   await s.opened         // the first connection, or a NetError
 *   s.send(text)           // lost while there is no open socket
 *
 * A close the relay didn't mean as final (a network change, the relay
 * restarting, a phone that slept) reconnects after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, then
 * every 4 s, and the relay gives the seat to the new socket. Messages sent
 * in between are lost, as packets on the air would be: what rides on top
 * resends what wasn't acknowledged. A connection that delivered messages and
 * then has gone silent for STALE_MS is reconnected once (a socket the network
 * dropped without a word looks open for minutes); it is not tried again until
 * something arrives.
 *
 * The relay's final close codes end it: `stopped` turns true and onError
 * hears why. Before the first open, `opened` rejects with a NetError instead,
 * and so it does if no connection opens in OPEN_TIMEOUT_MS (Fly may have to
 * start the relay's machine first).
